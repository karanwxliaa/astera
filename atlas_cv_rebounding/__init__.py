"""Atlas CV Rebounding

Minimal package for building a ShotQuality-style offensive rebounding
pipeline from broadcast video + play-by-play data.

This package is intentionally lightweight and modular. Many steps
require manual calibration (homography, frame anchors, team mapping)
which are described in the README and tutorial notebook.
